# Tiger Syndicate

## To Review
* People have different ways of doing things but what do you think of how I split up the pages since all pages will have the same metadata/header/footer/scripts?

## TODO
* game pages: 
    * Come up with a better way than having html(php) pages for each and every game.
    * Thinking of something like jQuery filter; labeling all html tags with respective game name as the class and filter them
    * use iframes instead
* game menu:
    * on click, the game menu skips ahead a bit
* preloader

## Issues
* web browser console says type mismatch for githubusercontent link (in scripts.php) for animating the color for the arrows in game menu

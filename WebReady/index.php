					Tiger Syndicate is an up and coming gaming label that strives to provide a positive community for gamers. Currently, we are competitive players who like to travel around to different cities and states playing amateur tournaments. We go to many events that are related to video games; as well as keeping up with current and future technology pertaining to games. We hope to expand our team into the professional leagues and make appearances at more events. We offer resources to obtain a firsthand analysis of new and upcoming games providing valuable game knowledge, as well as how to get the most enjoyment from each game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Current Mission: Right now Tiger Syndicate requires volunteers and people who are interested in streaming, We can help guide and assist you through this process with our decade knowledge of video games.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our main goal for Tiger Syndicate is to become a well known gaming organization that supports an array of gaming communities. We also want to expose unpopular games to the mainstream; and in the process of doing so, hopefully creating new metas for the game making it more enjoyable for existing and new players to that game.
				</p>
				<p>
					All is free to join and participate in our events.
